## Bugs to fix

Some of these bugs are browser specific. In the event you do not have access to the necessary browser (e.g. if you are working on an Apple device you won't have access to Internet Explorer) 
please give us potential solutions to these bugs.

You can find screenshots of the bugs at the following path 'design\bugs'

### Bug 1 - The page is not scaling correctly on mobile or tablet devices
The whole website is not rendering correctly on mobile and tablet - everything is really small.
When resizing the window on desktop everything renders correctly.
The website should look as per the mobile and tablet designs.

### Bug 2 - Logo does not appear in the header
The designs show that we are supposed to have a logo in the header, we can see that the logo is in the markup but this one isn't displayed.
The logo should be shown.

### Bug 3 - Heart icon should change color on click
When clicking on the heart icon in any of the cards the colour should change from black to red to indicate to the user that this product has been added to their favorite products.

### Bug 4 - User should be able to delete cards
When clicking on the cross icon in the card a modal should appear (as per design) and the user should be able to click on 'Delete' to remove this card.

### Bug 5 - Cards should be the same height as per design
Currently not all cards have the same height. We would like the cards to take the height of the largest one in each row. Not all rows need to be the same height.

### Bug 6 The side navigation shouldn't be displayed for screens under 480px
The side navigation should only be displayed on screens equal to or above this breakpoint.

### Bug 7 - Links in the side navigation do not work
When clicking on the side navigation links the user should be taken to the correct section.

### Bug 8 - Website is broken on IE11
When viewing the site in IE11 it isn't displaying correctly.
